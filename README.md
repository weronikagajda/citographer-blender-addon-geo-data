# Citographer Blender Addon Geo Data

Citography is a Blender add-on developed for spatial exploration as part of Citographer tool-kit Discord Channel, enabling users to explore collected data and experiment with its representation. Its goal is to confront and rethink the established methods of representing our surroundings. Through this, it invites users to criticaly reimagine the tools and perspectives employed for spatial exploration Instagram - see more.

This mapping tool is an integral part of the 'Citography' research of mine research group where I investigate the intersection of digital technology, space, and the citizens' experiences.

Recommendation:

To use the add-on's full potential, I recommend the wonderful BlenderGIS add-on, developed by domlysz. It enables the process of importing maps and georeferencing scenes.
